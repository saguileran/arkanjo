\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This tool uses as a subrotine the tool from \href{https://github.com/platisd/duplicate-code-detection-tool}{\texttt{ Duplicate Code Detection Tool}} as a subrotine to compare functions

The tool was created with the desire to facilitate code duplication detection and at the moment the tool it has the following functionalities\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Compare every pair of files with C code on a folder and return every pair that pass a threhold of similarity.
\item Given a file, return every file that the similarity with the file pass a threshold of similarity.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The concept of similarity is a black-\/box concept given by the \href{https://github.com/platisd/duplicate-code-detection-tool}{\texttt{ Duplicate Code Detection Tool}} with the help of Machine Learning.

Similarity of two objects is a number between on 0 and 100. Higher the number, higher the similarity between the objects.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md24}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Requirements}{Requirements}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md24}
It is required access to internet to download the subrotine tool.

It is required the g++. The standard C++ compiler in the GNU/\+Linux environment\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md25}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How to Setup}{How to Setup}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md25}
Execute the setup.\+sh script and follow the steps\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ bash\ setup.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


After you done the setup, you can request comparations about the folder you given to the tool while you run the setup script.

It is not stored setup\textquotesingle{}s. So if you want to check another code base you will lose the setup of a previous one.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md26}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{How to Run}{How to Run}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md26}
If you has done the standard setup. This is the following command you can execute with the tool\+:\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md27}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{find files that the similarity to a given file is greater or equal to a given value MIN}{find files that the similarity to a given file is greater or equal to a given value MIN}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md27}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ bash\ run.sh\ similar\ FILE\_NAME\ MIN\_SIMILARITY}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md28}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{finds the quantity and all pair of files that the similarity is greater or equal to a given value\+:}{finds the quantity and all pair of files that the similarity is greater or equal to a given value\+:}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md28}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ bash\ run.sh\ all\ MIN\_SIMILARITY}

\end{DoxyCode}


The output of the all command start with a number n, the number of comparations made by the tool.

The following n lines of the output has two strings s,t and a decimal number SIMILARITY, a pair of files compared and the similarity between them.

The list of comparations of the output is sorted by similarity in decending order.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md29}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Find files that the similarity to a given file from the output of the all command\+:}{Find files that the similarity to a given file from the output of the all command\+:}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md29}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo\ bash\ run.sh\ similar\_from\_all\ FILE\_NAME\ OUTPUT\_ALL}

\end{DoxyCode}


To execute the similar\+\_\+from\+\_\+all, save the output of an all command on a temporary file and pass the name of the file to the command.
