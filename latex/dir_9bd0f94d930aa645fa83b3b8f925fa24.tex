\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
I want to create some test cases to check the ability to detect duplication code on C code. This repository worth is store this test cases and document my finds.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{About Parser}{About Parser}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md31}
In fact none of the tools accomplished the expectations.

The only useful one are \href{https://github.com/platisd/duplicate-code-detection-tool}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/platisd/duplicate-\/code-\/detection-\/tool}}.

The parser\textquotesingle{}s folder are tools create to do more complex detectetion code.

\doxylink{classParser}{Parser} folder is about doing comparations in structs/functions scope, while file\+\_\+parser is do comparations in files scope.

At the moment, the parser tools uses the above tool as a subrotine to not do more repetitive work. But it can be changed if necessary.

Both tools has their own REAMDE. Read them to learn more.

Probably it is good to create a new repository to the parser folder, but I think about it latter when the tool is more solid.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{List of Candidate Tools to Test}{List of Candidate Tools to Test}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md32}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only able to detect repetition of TOKEN when specify TOKEN size.
\item Installed and tested it. Prety simple tool.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is a paid tool. Should I try it? I think not.
\item There is a free trial.

\href{https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/dlidstrom/\+Duplo}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I like it. It is only able to detect repetition of TOKEN.
\item For the tool. TOKEN is defined as a set of consecutive lines with a minimum size per line.
\item The output is easy to undertand and usage is easy with docker.
\item Prety simple tool.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is a paid tool.
\item It is free tool for open source projects. It is fully automate on a website
\item Search through github repository.
\item Do not check any .c file. Maybe I will try later with change extension to .cpp.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Duploc
\item There is a pape about that. Looks cool.
\item Unfortunaly, I was not able to find an source to test the tool.
\item Main source link on paper is broken.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It is a frond end aplication for \href{https://github.com/dlidstrom/Duplo}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/dlidstrom/\+Duplo}}
\item Look like it is easy to configurate.
\item I will not install it for know. Since it can only do what Duplo can do.

\href{https://github.com/platisd/duplicate-code-detection-tool}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/platisd/duplicate-\/code-\/detection-\/tool}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item As a first impression, it is a amazing tool.
\item Check similarity through different files and gives back a porcentage of similarity between each pair of files.
\item It is easy to install and use.
\item Support Git\+Hub Action. Looks easy to do CI/\+CD with it.
\item Do not check similarity on code of the same file. I.\+e, the tool cannot check a copy-\/paste code if the copy-\/paste happened on the same file.
